# Portfolio
This is my Portfolio Website!!!

I have made this website in order to showcase my work and gradually build it to eventually engage with the industry recruiters and also grow as a software developer myself.
This website would hopefully help me to keep track of my progress with applying my knowledge in making real projects.

1st Commit - Base Code and Setup and make the site live using the GIthub Pages.
